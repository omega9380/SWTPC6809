# MF-68 Disc System
The MF-68 Disc System is a dual mini-floppy disc system designed for a SWTPC 6800 Computer System.

The MF-68 consists of three major parts: the controller, the chassis and power supply and the drives themselves. The drives come pre-assembled and require only minor jumper changes to be used. The power supply is assembled partially on a small printed circuit board and partially thru point to point chassis wiring. The controller is assembled entirely on a 5 3/4" x 5" circuit board that will plug into an I/0 slot on the computer's mother board. Connection between the controller and the drives is made via a 34 conductor ribbon cable.
Introduced by Southwest Technical Products Corporation in August 1977. The MF-68 kit cost $995
