# MP-09 Processor Board
The MP-09 processor, board is intended for use in Southwest Technical Products Corporation or, similar computer systems using the SS-50 bus system. It consists of the MC6809 processor, ROM monitor, memory management system and buffering circuits. The board requires a 7 to 9 Volt unregulated DC voltage at approximately 1.0 Amp. The MP-09 may be used to replace 6800 processor boards in most any SWTPC 6800 computer system.

The MP-09 was introduced in March 1979 for $175 kit and $195 assembled. It was soon upgraded to the MP-09A. (There were layout problems in the first MP-09 boards.) The MP-09B was introduced in 1980. Some of the differences are shown in Application Note 127.
