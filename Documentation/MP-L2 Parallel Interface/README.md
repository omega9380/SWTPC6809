# MP-L2 Parallel Interface

The MP-L2 parallel interface is a 5 1/4" wide x 4 3/4" high interface board implemented with the 6821 peripheral interface adaptor integrated circuit. The MP L2 is used to interface parallel type devices, such as printers, to the computer system. The board is provided with two separate DB 25 connectors with each providing 8 input or output lines, two additional output lines, and two control lines. Input or output selection is done via software programming. Software control of the interrupt lines and handshake polarity is also provided.

Introduced by Southwest Technical Products Corporation in 1978. Assembled MP-L2 was $120.
